TODO for v01, aka proof of concept 2
- main goal is to have a city generator with somewhat complete / mock up features ready
[V] edit to make file as global, do not need to pass stlfile
[V] 3d funcs into utils.py
[ ] all new files configured through JSON
[ ] populate streets
[ ] sort bld_rects in blocks: inner or outer
[ ] create placeholders for functions: bld (just boxes, random h)


TODO for v02
- clean up, implement all the little features before attacking buildings
[ ] finish primitives: cone, cylinder
[ ] finish tree generation
[ ] populate streets
[ ] proper JSON everywhere
[ ] instead of awkward for loops with idx in range => do idx, val in enumerate
[ ] 2d rect should be standardised!

TODO fro v03
[ ] bld generation
[ ] trucks on the roads: takes up two spaces and are higher!
