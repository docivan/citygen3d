VERSION v01, aka proof of concept 1
- main goal is that a city can be generated and printed
[V] block gen + simple buildings
- finished night 13.11.2018

VERSION v02, aka proof of concept 2
- main goal is to have a city generator with somewhat complete / mock up features ready
[V] edit to make file as global, do not need to pass stlfile
[V] 3d funcs into utils.py
[V] all new files configured through JSON
[V] populate streets
[V] sort bld_rects in blocks: inner or outer
[V] create placeholders for functions: bld (just boxes, random h)
[V] release breaking bugs: 001 + 002
[V] migrate to GitHub
-finished during early hours of 14.11.2018, including git

VERSION v03, stability, clean up, setting up a more solid foundation for later
- clean up, implement all the little features before attacking buildings etc
[V] comment stripping from json config file
[V] finish primitives: cone, cylinder
[V] finish tree generation
[ ] streets.py is a mess
[ ] proper JSON everywhere
[V] fix JSON comments, see BUG003
[ ] instead of awkward for loops with idx in range => do idx, val in enumerate
[ ] 2d rect should be standardised!
[ ] move cmp float to utils?
[ ] using randint for height for example - should be float!
[ ] debug visualization shoudl reflect
[ ] refactor main.py file - rename citygen3.py, split, perhaps make __main__ function, etc
[V] assert subdivs
[V] test blender intersect geometry fix
[ ] replace "cube" with "box"
[ ] cube creation should be cleaned up - not always drawing ccw!!
[ ] check that all 3d functions have the correct asserts!
[V] cubed spheres for trees - saving poly count, no impact on quality and saving ourselves from slicing pains

VERSION v04
[ ] bld generation
[ ] proper car generation?
[ ] cars should nonetheless be 3d structures!
[ ] trucks on the roads: takes up two spaces and are higher!

[ ] helipad
