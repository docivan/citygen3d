VERSION v03, stability, clean up, setting up
- clean up, implement all the little features before attacking buildings etc
[ ] finish primitives: cone, cylinder
[ ] finish tree generation
[ ] streets.py is a mess
[ ] proper JSON everywhere
[ ] instead of awkward for loops with idx in range => do idx, val in enumerate
[ ] 2d rect should be standardised!
[ ] move cmp float to utils?
[ ] using randint for height for example - should be float!
[ ] debug visualization shoudl reflect
[ ] refactor main.py file - rename citygen3.py, split, perhaps make __main__ function, etc

VERSION v04
[ ] bld generation
[ ] trucks on the roads: takes up two spaces and are higher!
