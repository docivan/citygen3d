VERSION v01, aka proof of concept 1
- main goal is that a city can be generated and printed
[V] block gen + simple buildings
- finished night 13.11.2018

VERSION v02, aka proof of concept 2
- main goal is to have a city generator with somewhat complete / mock up features ready
[V] edit to make file as global, do not need to pass stlfile
[V] 3d funcs into utils.py
[V] all new files configured through JSON
[V] populate streets
[V] sort bld_rects in blocks: inner or outer
[V] create placeholders for functions: bld (just boxes, random h)
[V] release breaking bugs: 001 + 002
[V] migrate to GitHub
-finished during early hours of 14.11.2018, including git

VERSION v03, stability, clean up, setting up a more solid foundation for later
- clean up, implement all the little features before attacking buildings etc
[V] comment stripping from json config file
[V] finish primitives: cone, cylinder
[V] finish tree generation
[ ] streets.py is a mess
[ ] proper JSON everywhere
[V] fix JSON comments, see BUG003
[ ] instead of awkward for loops with idx in range => do idx, val in enumerate
[ ] 2d rect should be standardised!
[ ] move cmp float to utils?
[ ] using randint for height for example - should be float!
[ ] debug visualization: separate functions
[ ] refactor main.py file - rename citygen3.py, split, perhaps make __main__ function, etc
[V] assert subdivs
[V] test blender intersect geometry fix
[ ] replace "cube" with "box"
[ ] cube creation should be cleaned up - not always drawing ccw!!
[ ] check that all 3d functions have the correct asserts!
[V] cubed spheres for trees - saving poly count, no impact on quality and saving ourselves from slicing pains
[ ] trunk ratio as configurable param
[X] consider complex trees = trunk with expanding cone, then cyl on top, then half-sphere to cap off
[ ] or just skip the trunk: expanding subdiv trunc cone, then cyl with same subdiv, then half-sphere
[ ] tree height should be considerably larger
[ ] complex pine: expanding subdiv trunc cone, then sharp-domed cone
[ ] for the above: expand cone function to be "lofted" (arbitrary number for rings in z-dir)
[ ] in addition: "loft" box function with arbitrary number of z-rings
[ ] __circle2d_xy should envoke 2d circle point generator
[ ] tree types: complex cone, cyl w half-sphere on top, cyl w/o sphere, cubed sphere as now
[X] the two generators in buildings.py should be using the same architecture, not 2 diff approaches
[V] PRI!! building segm render should be able to gen WESN segments (facades?!?)
[ ] above should be solved by: which sides to gen? and which subdiv to use
[ ] custom distrib function (bilinear? = x^2 function with cutoff where it crosses x-axis)
[V] custom distrib function
[ ] fully implement exp distrib, right now just a stub - implement cutoff!
[V] PRI! facade decor
[ ] if continue development: min structural elem size should be enforced, also for ledges!
[V] bld generation
[V] proper car generation?
[ ] rename style with profile
[V] a way to calib min resolution?
[ ] operations on rects (like width and height) should be defined in model3d or utils

VERSION v04
[ ] cars should nonetheless be 3d structures!
[ ] trucks on the roads: takes up two spaces and are higher!
[ ] cars turning?
[ ] helipad
[ ] gen height map while making buildings -
